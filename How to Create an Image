If you are using an image from your desktop file, you need to drag the image to your repository issues box to get the url.
After you drag the image to the repositury issues input box, it will generate the image url for you.
Copy and paste the image url to the code below.
<img src=”url" alt=”my banner”>
Put this code into your README.md file.
Note: you can't use the CSS file for the code in the README.md. You have to style inside the HTML element if you want to align or size the image. 
Example: 
<p align=”center”>

<img width=”200" height=”200" src=”url" alt=”my banner”>

</p>
